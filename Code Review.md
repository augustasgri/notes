## Code Style
- [ ] Project's formatting style is applied
- [ ] Code adheres to the agreed-upon naming conventions
- [ ] Code is DRY
- [ ] Code is sufficiently *"readable"* (method lengths, method return types, parameter names, etc.)

## Tests
- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] New features are tested
- [ ] Corner cases are tested
- [ ] Using unit tests where possible, functional tests where necessary
- [ ] Tests for Non-Functional Requirements (optional)

## Documentation
- [ ] New features are documented
- [ ] All relevant types of documentation are covered (README, API, user guide, reference docs, etc.)
- [ ] Documentation is understandable and free of significant typos and grammar mistakes

## Implementation Semantics
- [ ] Requirements are satisfied
- [ ] Logic is correct
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity
- [ ] Implementation is robust (i.e. no concurrency issues, proper error handling, etc.)
- [ ] Implementation is performant
- [ ] No security issues (SQL injections, etc.)
- [ ] Implementation is observable (metrics, logging, tracing, etc.)
- [ ] New dependencies are pulling their weight and their licenses are acceptable.

## API Semantics
- [ ] It is as small as possible and as large as needed
- [ ] There is one way of doing a thing, not multiple
- [ ] It is consistent and follows the principle of least surprise
- [ ] Clean split of API and internals without internals leaking into the API
- [ ] No breaking changes to user-facing parts (API classes, configuration, metrics, log formats, etc.)
- [ ] New API is generally useful and not overly specific to a single use case
